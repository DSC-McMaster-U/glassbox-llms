# Glassbox LLMs Implementation Plan - 7 Sprint Roadmap  

## 🏁 Sprint 1 — Understanding the Problem (Week 1)

**Goal**: Build shared literacy on LLM interpretability foundations and setup environment.

**Outcome**: Everyone understands why interpretability is hard and what current methods exist.

## 🔍 Sprint 2 — Identify the Research Gap & Define Glassbox’s Direction (Week 2) 

**Goal**: Conduct a lightweight “literature audit” and pick a concrete research gap the library will address.
**Focus**:
- In depth review of recent papers, open-source interpretability tools (e.g., TransformerLens, DeepEval, Captum, OpenDecomp).
- Discuss which parts are missing or impractical for real-world systems.
- Define the core Glassbox mission (e.g., “dynamic interpretability for LLM pipelines”).

**Deliverables**:
- Research gap summary (1-2 pages)
- Library vision doc (`/docs/vision.md`)
- Backlog of experimental ideas

## 🧠 Sprint 3 — Experimental Prototyping: Interpretability at Scale (Week 3)

**Goal**: Explore one or two interpretability methods on a realistic model setup.

**Focus**:
- Pick an open-weight model (Gemma, Llama-3, Mistral).
- Implement 1–2 interpretability methods (e.g., activation patching, Integrated Gradients).
- Try running them on longer prompts, or streamed inference. 

**Deliverables**:
- Prototype notebooks
- Observations on scalability & limitations
- Draft design for modular Glassbox components (e.g., `glassbox.visualize`, `glassbox.attribution`)

## 🧰 Sprint 4 — Design Glassbox Core Library (Weeks 4-5)

**Goal**: Build a lightweight modular library architecture informed by findings from Sprint 3.

**Focus**:
- Define abstractions: e.g.
- `GlassModel`: wraps an LLM for analysis
- `GlassProbe`: probing/attribution interface
- `GlassViz`: visualization module
- Integrate Hugging Face + PyTorch hooks for flexibility

**Deliverables**:
- Working code skeleton (`/glassbox_llms/`)
- Example notebooks demonstrating usage
- Draft documentation

## ☁️ Sprint 5 — Cloud & Pipeline Integration (Week 6-7)

**Goal**: Make interpretability usable in real-world LLM systems.
**Focus**:
- Experiment with cloud deployment:
- Log outputs + intermediate activations to a database (e.g., using Weights & Biases, Vertex AI, or AWS S3).
- Build simple dashboards (Streamlit, Gradio) to visualize interpretability results live.
- Explore integration with LangChain or OpenDevin-like pipelines.

**Deliverables**:
- Cloud-ready “Glassbox Monitor” prototype
- Integration guide: “Using Glassbox in a pipeline”

## 🔬 Sprint 6 — Evaluation & Research Contribution (Week 8)

**Goal**: Validate whether Glassbox meaningfully improves understanding or debugging.

**Focus**:
- Evaluate on tasks like: bias detection, hallucination tracking, or prompt sensitivity.
- Collect both quantitative (agreement, stability) and qualitative (human interpretability) results.
- Draft a research-style short paper or poster on findings.

**Deliverables**:
- Evaluation report
- Paper/poster draft 
- Summary of open research questions

## 🚀 Sprint 7 — Open-Source Release & Future Expansion (Week 9-10)

**Goal**: Prepare Glassbox for open release and external collaboration.

**Focus**:
- Refactor codebase for clarity and packaging
- Add examples, documentation, and tutorials
- Optional: release on PyPI
- Identify future contributions (new modules, model types, visual dashboards)

**Deliverables**:
- glassbox-llms v0.1 release
- Project website or GitHub Pages site
- Outreach to open-source community
