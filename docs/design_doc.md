🧠 Glassbox Library Design Document
# 1. Overview

The Glassbox Library provides a modular, lightweight, and framework-agnostic foundation for exploring LLM interpretability. Its architecture prioritizes:

Independence between modules

Extensibility for future research directions

Testability — all modules can be unit tested in isolation

Minimal external dependencies, relying only on standard Python and NumPy/matplotlib where necessary

The code entry point (e.g., main.py or cli.py) can integrate with models, datasets, or APIs, but the core modules must remain agnostic to them.

# 2. Core Modules
## 🧩 GlassModel

Purpose:
Provides a generic interface for model abstraction, activation extraction, and causal experimentation.

Responsibilities:

Manage hooks to extract activations from arbitrary model layers.

Provide a consistent API for forward passes, activation capture, and patching.

Stay independent of any specific framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).

Optional adapters (e.g., HuggingFace) should live in glassbox.adapters.

Design Principles:

Define only abstract data flow: encode() → forward() → get_activations().

Accept generic tensor types (np.ndarray, torch.Tensor, etc.) via typing.Union.

Support lightweight dependency injection for model backends.

Testability:

Use mock models (simple linear or dictionary-based) for unit tests.

Verify logic of hooks, activation caching, and patching without real networks.

## 🔍 GlassProbe

Purpose:
Implements probe interfaces for testing hypotheses about what information is represented in activations.

Responsibilities:

Provide a clean, dependency-light probe API: fit(), predict(), evaluate().

Support any backend (NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch) via adapter registration.

Remain independent of both GlassModel and external datasets.

Design Principles:

Treat probes as pluggable components — linear classifiers by default.

Expose metrics as return values (accuracy, F1, mutual information).

Avoid coupling to specific feature shapes or tokenizers.

Testability:

Use synthetic activations (NumPy arrays) and labels to verify training logic.

Ensure reproducible results without relying on model weights.

## 🎨 GlassViz

Purpose:
Provide visualization utilities for attention, attribution, and activation distributions.

Responsibilities:

Offer standardized plotting functions for interpretability outputs:

attention_map()

attribution_heatmap()

activation_hist()

Stay independent of modeling frameworks and only depend on matplotlib.

Design Principles:

Pure visualization — no model calls.

Accept simple Python lists or arrays; return figure handles for testability.

All visuals should be reproducible and usable in notebooks or dashboards.

Testability:

Validate that plotting functions run without exceptions and return a matplotlib.Figure.

Avoid rendering-heavy tests (mock plt.show()).

Each module is standalone: they can be imported independently.

Shared types (e.g., TensorLike, ActivationDict) reside in glassbox/types.py.

Optional integrations live in glassbox/adapters/ (for HF, OpenAI, etc.).

Tests live in tests/ and mock only internal logic.

# 4. Development & Testing Best Practices
Principle	Implementation
Loose Coupling	Avoid direct imports between modules (e.g., GlassProbe never calls GlassModel).
Dependency Injection	Allow backend objects (e.g., models, datasets) to be passed at runtime.
Unit Testing	Mock external dependencies; test pure logic and data flow.
Linter/Formatter	Use ruff for linting and black/PEP8 conventions.
Type Checking	Enforce mypy strictness for clean API boundaries.
Documentation	Each module includes docstrings and usage examples.

# 5. Example Usage (Conceptual)
from glassbox import GlassModel, GlassProbe, GlassViz

## 1. Load model & capture activations
gm = GlassModel.from_hf("bert-base-uncased")
acts = gm.get_activations(inputs=["The cat sat on the mat"], layers=[1, 3, 5])

## 2. Train a probe on the activations
probe = GlassProbe(task_name="syntax")
probe.fit(X=acts["layer_3"], labels=[0, 1])
acc = probe.evaluate(X=acts["layer_3"], labels=[0, 1])

## 3. Visualize attention or attribution
viz = GlassViz()
viz.attention_map(attn=[[0.2, 0.8], [0.5, 0.5]], tokens=["The", "cat"])

# 6. Future Extensions

glassbox.adapters → interfaces for frameworks (HuggingFace, OpenAI, Anthropic).

glassbox.metrics → standardized interpretability evaluation metrics.

glassbox.data → synthetic datasets for probing experiments.

glassbox.cli → optional command-line integration.

glassbox.web → optional visualization dashboard.
